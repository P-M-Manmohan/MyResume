        Art
        <p>
          I like to draw in my free time it could be with graphite on paper or
          digital. I also paint sometimes. I definitely wouldnt consider myself
          good at any of these but im simply happy to be able to do it.

        Anime/Manga
        <p>
          I started watching anime from when i was around 11 or 12 after which i
          slowly moved to manga. The first anime i watched was Naruto and the
          first manga i read was demon slayer. Anime also sometimes given me
          inspiration to draw.
